Collins and Pinch → The main purpose of the reading, Chapter 6 ("The science of the lambs: Chernobyl and the Cumbrian sheepfarmers") from _The Golem at Large_, is to **transform the understanding of scientific expertise** by illustrating its fallibility and the critical need for honest communication with the public.

Specifically, the chapter aims to:

1. **Expose Scientific Fallibility:** To demonstrate that science is characterized by the **"normal open-ended nature of golem science"** rather than absolute certainty. The chapter details how scientists' initial assessments were wrong because they relied on flawed models (assuming radio-caesium would lock up in lowland clay soils) and **overlooked existing data** regarding upland acid, peaty soils.

2. **Critique Expert Arrogance:** To show how the scientists' **"overweening certainty"** and refusal to admit mistakes or credit the farmers' **practical expertise** undermined public faith in science. Officials displayed "ignorance of the complexity" of fell sheepfarming, offering unrealistic advice that further damaged their credibility.

3. **Advocate for a Stable Relationship:** To argue that the resulting public distrust—where farmers flipped from viewing science as absolute certainty to viewing it as a **political conspiracy**—is an undesirable state. The authors conclude that a **healthier climate** for resolving public concerns requires scientists to admit to uncertainties and treat lay groups as having relevant expertise.
