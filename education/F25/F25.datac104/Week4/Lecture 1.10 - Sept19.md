# Rules and Risk
What are the politics of automated risk-assessment? Of fairness? How are they involved in making social order?


## What makes social order?  
Social contract theory (Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau)  
Class conflict and the mode of production (Karl Marx)  
Political authority and legitimacy (Max Weber)  
Division of labor (Emile Durkheim)  
(Also, kinship, exchange, shared norms, communication)

## Liberalism 
Liberalism as a political tradition, philosophy, and style of governance 
As a form of social order

## Liberalism, Quantification, and Impartiality  
Rule of law: liberal state and its laws as a neutral, impartial machine (e.g.  the judge as automaton)  
Trust in numbers: quantification a “technology of distance” for building trust

## Why did “fairness” take off in the 1970’s?  
John Rawls, A Theory of Justice (1971): “Justice as fairness”  
Civil Rights Movement and anti-discrimination law


## Why did “fairness” take off in the 1970’s?  
Structural transformations in 20th century politics and economics that were entangled with statistical risk assessment.  
What ideas and models of social order are embedded in risk assessment practices?  
What forms of social order does risk assessment support?  
What forms of social order support risk-assessment?

## Co-production ⤱  
Technology and society are mutually constitutive  
- They depend on one another for the forms they take  
- Technology makes society what it is, and society makes technology what it is  
Symmetry at the heart of co-production:  
- Acknowledges the equal role that both technological factors and social factors play in making the world the way that it is  
- Recognizes that both technology and society are dynamic and change

## Collectivizing risk during the industrial revolution  
“Workmen’s compensation” and industrial accidents (19th century)


### Summary of "Rules and Risk" Lecture

This lecture explores the politics of automated risk assessment and the concept of "fairness," examining how these ideas are used to create and maintain social order. It positions these concepts within the historical context of liberalism, tracing the evolution of risk from a collective responsibility under the welfare state to an individualized one under neoliberalism. The central argument is that modern "actuarial fairness" was co-produced with the shift to neoliberalism and serves as a key template for governance today.

#### **Core Framework: Co-Production**

The lecture's primary analytical tool is "co-production," the idea that technology and society are mutually constitutive and dynamic. This framework rejects simple technological or social determinism, instead acknowledging the equal and interdependent roles that technological and social factors play in shaping the world. The lecture uses this concept to analyze how risk-assessment technologies and societal ideas about fairness developed in tandem, creating feedback loops that reinforced each other over time.

#### **The Historical Evolution of Risk and Fairness**

The lecture traces the concept of risk through several major historical transformations:

- **Early Capitalism**: Actuarial methods first emerged in the 17th century for commercial marine insurance, marking an early application of statistical risk calculation.
- **Collectivizing Risk**: During the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, risk began to be collectivized through programs like "Workmen’s compensation" for industrial accidents. This trend expanded significantly in the 20th century with the rise of the welfare state, exemplified by the New Deal and the creation of Social Security in the 1930s, which socialized risk across the population.
- **Individualizing Risk**: Alongside collectivization, a parallel trend of individualizing risk began with private life insurance in the 19th century. This approach gained significant momentum in the latter half of the 20th century.
- **The Rise of "Fairness"**: The concept of "fairness" gained prominence in the 1970s, heavily influenced by John Rawls's philosophical work _A Theory of Justice_ (1971) and the legal frameworks established by the Civil Rights Movement and anti-discrimination law.

#### **The Shift to Neoliberalism and "Actuarial Fairness"**

The lecture argues that the contemporary understanding of fairness has been co-produced with the erosion of the welfare state and the rise of neoliberalism. This modern conception, termed "actuarial fairness," defines fairness as individual responsibility for one's own risk. Its legitimacy grew out of legal and social debates, such as the unisex insurance debates of the 1970s and 1980s, where risk-based discrimination was debated and ultimately legitimized.

This shift was enabled by technological advancements, as the increasing availability of granular data and computing power allowed for more individualized risk assessments. Risk assessment became a template for neoliberal governance, with actuarial fairness providing its "moral infrastructure". An example of this is credit scoring, which functions as both a technology of trust and an engine of class formation.

#### **Consequences of Individualized Risk Assessment**

The lecture outlines several critical implications of this shift toward automated, individualized risk assessment as a mode of governance:

- **Erosion of Solidarity**: It emphasizes personal responsibility for security and misfortune, which in turn erodes the political basis for redistribution and collective solidarity.
- **Socioeconomic Sorting**: Powerful private and public agencies use these algorithmic systems as a primary means of sorting people into different socioeconomic tracks.
- **New Form of Governance**: It changes the relationship between the state and the individual. Governance shifts from managing sovereign citizens or legal subjects to managing aggregates of individuals as "human capital" or "risk portfolios".

Ultimately, the lecture concludes that fairness is not a static concept but has a distinct history. The modern focus on actuarial fairness is co-produced with neoliberalism and serves to truncate more radical claims to social equality.

**Next Step Suggestion:**

A useful next step would be to apply the **co-production framework** to a modern case study not mentioned in the text, such as algorithmic hiring or predictive policing. We could use the diagnostic questions provided to analyze how technology and social factors (like definitions of "merit" or "crime") are mutually shaping each other in these domains and what the stakes are for different groups. This would help translate the lecture's theoretical concepts into a concrete, practical analysis relevant to contemporary strategic decisions.
