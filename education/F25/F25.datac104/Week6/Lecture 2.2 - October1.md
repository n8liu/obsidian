### I. The Contingency and Performativity of Categories

The lecture challenges the assumed stability of concepts like "personality" and "self." Personality, now taken for granted as defining what sets individuals apart, is in truth a historically specific concept that only took off around the turn of the 20th century, similar to the 19th-century concept of character. The core argument is that classification schemes—the concepts and categories we use—do not merely describe the world, but actively change its appearance and function as "grids or filters" through which we perceive reality.

**Examples of Performativity:**

- The concept of species appears real, even though certain organisms (like the Ensatina salamander) can interbreed across "species" lines.
- Racial categories felt real in Apartheid South Africa because society was put into those boxes and people acted accordingly, despite individuals not fitting neatly into classifications.
- The binary view of gender feels real due to early training, contrasting with historical counter-examples like the Amazons.
- The phrase "more depends on what things are called than what they are" (Nietzsche) captures this dynamic.

**Performativity in Social Acts and Measurements:** Performativity is not about faking an action, but the work certain words and concepts perform within a specific context. For example, saying "I do" at a wedding creates a new social relationship.

Measurements are also performative:

- The **inch** has no natural correlate but is crucial to architects and engineers and cannot be replaced without a systemic overhaul.
- The **Air Quality Index (AQI)** did not exist prior to the 20th century but feels concrete because it has been incorporated into vocabulary and institutions.
- **Gross Domestic Product (GDP)**, which arrived post-WWII, began as a descriptive metric but now restricts our understanding of prosperity.

### II. The Co-Production of the Self Through Data

It is difficult to describe ourselves without using labels and boxes, which constitute a kind of data about us, whether qualitative or quantitative (e.g., digital self-tracking).

**The History of Self-Tracking:** Self-tracking is an old concept:

- **Ben Franklin** tracked his "sins" (against virtues like temperance or humility) using a journal of tables and charts, aiming to keep the table empty. Franklin adapted tabulation technology from statecraft and accounting to make his own person "legible," essentially objectifying himself to see himself from without.
- An even earlier example is the 16th-century Italian physician **Santorio**, who tracked his biomedical data.

**The Quantified Self and Self-Discipline:** Franklin's legacy continues in the modern **Quantified Self** movement and self-improvement culture, where data is crucial for the optimizing drive. Tracking biometric data or counting other metrics are techniques of self-discipline, following the ancient maxim "know thyself". This process involves turning the self into an object that can be quantified, managed, and disciplined.

The performativity lens shows that attempting to "know ourselves" through quantification fundamentally changes our self-understanding.

### III. From Character to Managed Personality

The shift from the concept of _character_ to _personality_ is linked to institutional needs for management.

- **Personality Tests:** The **MBTI** changes how test takers view themselves and their life decisions. Historically, the **WWI Woolworth Personal Data Sheet** was the first personality test, designed to screen US military recruits for the likelihood of developing PTSD.
- Personality tests are now used by governments, institutions, and mental health professionals either to manage people or to help them self-manage.
- Apps encourage users to share personality test results, demonstrating that self-tracking has a social component, and personality only makes sense in a relational context.

### IV. The Cyborg Self and Contingency

Self emerges "from without"; we lack a concept of selfhood until we are asked to give an account of ourselves from some outside source (Judith Butler). Gender identity, for instance, is an effect of the performance of gender, and we become gendered by acting out our roles.

Likewise, self-tracking is performative and changes our idea of self. There is no essential self absolutely prior to or separate from the technologies we live with; datafication shapes our self-experience.

The source describes humans as **cyborgs** or **cybernetic organisms** because we are "meshed with our personal data," and without this data, our lives would be different. The self is an artifact—something _made_ (not just found) together with technology and society—making it contingent and variable. Ways of being a self are products of the performativity of classifications, sociotechnical systems, norms, and practices. The cyborg figure highlights the human being as porous and relational, constructed by personal, social, biological, and technical elements.
