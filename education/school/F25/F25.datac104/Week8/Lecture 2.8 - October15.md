The reading explicitly draws upon feminist Science and Technology Studies (STS) scholarship and related concepts, including situated knowledge, to challenge mainstream assumptions about "openness".

Core Tenets of the Feminist Perspective

The feminist lens provides the conceptual tools necessary to address power dynamics and inequity in open science practices:

1. Situating Openness and Power Analysis: The perspective emphasizes that openness is never universally positive or neutral. Building on the feminist concept of situated knowledge, it introduces situated openness, which recognizes that openness intersects with interlocking systems of privilege and oppression (such as patriarchy, capitalism, and settler colonialism). This intersection determines who benefits and who is at risk in an open system. Furthermore, the feminist perspective mandates constantly interrogating whose interests openness is serving and whose it is neglecting, viewing openness as a mechanism to mobilize power that can either disrupt or strengthen existing power structures.

2. Risk and Harm Reduction: Drawing from feminist anti-violence work, this approach views open science as a strategy for risk and harm reduction. It necessitates asking what participants are gaining and risking in a project and designing practices that reduce vulnerability and increase safety for those involved.

3. Informed Consent and Refusal: A feminist perspective highlights the necessity of informed consent and refusal in research. This means ensuring the ability to make informed and conscious decisions and explicitly signal permission or refusal regarding one’s digital bodies (data, images, or text). Consent should not be a one-time event, but rather something continually revisited throughout the research cycle.

4. Addressing Non-Innocence and Responsibility: The perspective requires researchers to address their own "non-innocence" by assessing their position within systems of privilege and recognizing how they may contribute to uneven power dynamics. This involves abandoning paternalistic views, recognizing inherent biases, and embracing the responsibility to proactively negotiate power, difference, and conflict in research relationships.

Overall, reimagining open science from a feminist perspective has been identified as an "incredibly useful starting point" for OCSDNet to understand how diverse forms of power are embedded in relationships and infrastructures, and whether they procure the safety and wellbeing of those who sit at the intersections of several systems of oppression.
