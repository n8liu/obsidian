Based on the sources provided, the development of statistics is fundamentally intertwined with the rise of the modern state and its need to govern its population. Statistics originated as a "science of the state," providing the tools for administrations to see, manage, and shape the people and territory under their control.

### States, Populations, and the Need for Data

The modern **state** is a political structure tied to a specific territory with a permanent population, all under the sovereign control of a government. A **population** is the group of people living within that state, subject to its administration. European states began systematically collecting population data for several key reasons:

- **To Establish Sovereignty:** The principle that "knowledge is power" drove states to gather information as a means of control, which went beyond simply having a monopoly on violence.
- **Administrative Aims:** Data was essential for governing. This included increasing the territory's wealth, raising revenues through **taxes**, and raising armies.
- **Biopower:** States became interested in growing the population and improving its health, a concept Michel Foucault termed **biopower**.

### The "State" in Statistics

The connection between the state and statistics is evident in the word's origin and historical practice. Two major traditions highlight this relationship:

- **English "Political Arithmetic":** Developed in the late 1600s by figures like William Petty and John Graunt, this approach focused on "vital statistics" like births and deaths. It used numerical data, presented in tables and visualizations, to see the population in a quantitative, abstract way.
- **German "Statistik":** This term literally means **"science of the state"**. It was a more qualitative and holistic practice aimed at increasing state power by managing territory, natural resources, and trade.

Fundamentally, modern statistics, the concept of a "population," and the modern state are considered to have been **co-produced**; they developed together and shaped one another.

### How the State "Sees" its Population

To govern, the state must simplify the complex reality of human life. It does this through several mechanisms:

- **The Administrative Grid:** The state uses intellectual filters to make reality legible. By abstracting away certain details and **standardizing** information, it can make different people and places comparable and countable.
- **Performativity:** State classifications do more than just describe the world; they actively shape it. For example, the first U.S. Census in 1790 didn't just count people; its categories for race, sex, and status (free or slave) created official divisions that reflected the priorities of its makers and transformed the reality it was measuring.

### Social Regularities and the "Average Man"

During the 1820s-1850s, an "avalanche of printed numbers" from state administrations allowed new social insights.

- **Adolphe Quetelet** observed that rates of social phenomena like births, deaths, marriages, and even crimes and suicides remained remarkably stable over time.
- This led to the idea of **"Social Physics,"** a new science that sought to uncover the laws governing society, much like physics uncovers the laws of nature. This perspective shifted responsibility for things like crime from the individual to society as a whole.
- Quetelet applied the Gaussian probability distribution, or **normal curve**, to human traits like height and weight. From this, he developed the concept of **"The Average Man"** (l'homme moyen) as an ideal type or norm.
- Deviations from this average were considered "abnormal" or "pathological". This introduction of **"normality"** and the practice of "norming" populations laid a crucial foundation for modern mathematical statistics.
