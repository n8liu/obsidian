Based on the sources provided, modern mathematical statistics and the practice of eugenics are historically entangled. Key statistical methods were developed to advance eugenics, a state and elite-driven practice of managing human populations that was often linked to white supremacist, elitist, and ableist ideologies.

### The Role of Francis Galton

Francis Galton, a cousin of Charles Darwin, was a central figure in shaping both statistics and eugenics.

- **Motivations:** Inspired by Darwin, Galton sought to apply artificial selection to human society, manipulating the inheritance of traits. He was particularly interested in "genius" as an inheritable trait and aimed to improve England's "racial stock".
- **Statistical Innovations:** He pioneered linear regression while studying height data to understand heredity. He coined the term "regression" to describe the pattern of "reversion towards mediocrity," which we now call regression toward the mean.
- **Application of Statistics to Eugenics:** Galton adapted the bell curve to formalize "intelligence" as a measurable trait, believing "talent" was normally distributed. He viewed outliers on one end of the curve as the ideal and those on the other as "socially unworthy". He mapped existing social classes and racial differences onto these curves, presuming the divisions reflected natural ability. To collect data for his work, he established an "Anthropometric Laboratory" to measure human traits like eyesight, strength, and height.

### The Co-Production of Statistics and Eugenics

Statistics played a crucial role in establishing eugenics as an objective science of the state.

- Galton’s protégé Karl Pearson and his contemporary Ronald Fisher developed statistical techniques to address problems arising from the eugenics context.
- **Significance testing**, for example, gained prominence from the need to argue that different populations or races were distinct.
- Pearson's focus on **correlation over causation** helped to naturalize observable differences between populations, such as races or nations.
- In essence, **modern mathematical statistics was co-produced with eugenics**.

### The Anatomy and Practice of Eugenics

Eugenics, a term coined by Galton meaning "well-born," is the science and practice of selective human breeding. It is an exercise of **biopower**, which involves state-directed "better breeding" of human populations.

- **Core Principles:** It assumes human populations are biological entities that should be "normed" according to criteria of fitness or social worth, which are claimed to be measurable and biologically determined. These populations can then be managed and optimized through scientific and political intervention.
- **Motivating Anxieties:** The movement was driven by fears of biological degeneration in modern societies, concerns about national vitality, and differing fertility rates between "desirable" and "undesirable" groups. As a result, women's bodies and fertility became a primary target of eugenic practices.

Eugenics was put into practice in two main ways:

- **Positive Eugenics:** Encouraging the reproduction of "desirable" traits through methods like selective marriages.
- **Negative Eugenics:** Preventing the reproduction of "undesirable" traits through marriage bans, sterilization, euthanasia, and immigration controls.

In the United States, eugenics was institutionalized through organizations like the Eugenic Records Office and was used to manage immigration, disability, poverty, and criminality through sterilizations and anti-miscegenation laws. California performed 20,000 sterilizations, and Stanford University was a central site for eugenics, particularly through Lewis Terman's development of the Stanford-Binet IQ test.

### Legacies of Eugenics

The influence of eugenics persists today. Its "afterlives" can be seen in:

- Private family decisions influenced by genetic counseling, screening, and ancestry research.
- Global economic development policies focused on women's fertility in "developing" countries.
- Enduring legacies such as **IQ testing, scientific racism, the nature vs. nurture debate, and U.S. immigration restrictions**.
