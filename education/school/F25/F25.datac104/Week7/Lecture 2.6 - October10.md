**Lowry Presley** → he purpose of this reading is to challenge the modern "ideology of information," which assumes that human life benefits from maximum knowledge, arguing instead that this pervasive view has "impoverished" human existence. The text introduces the concept of **oblivion**, defining it as a form of obscurity about which "there is no information or knowledge one way or the other," and which is essential for "potentiality, depth, play, and freedom". A central claim is that privacy’s value lies not in enabling control over information that already exists, but in protecting against the creation of such information in the first place
- oblivion is a good thing in regards to privacy
### I. The Terms of Service (ToS) Approach

The Terms of Service (ToS) approach establishes a legal relationship where a user consents to be bound by the terms and receives service in exchange for providing data.

This approach maps directly onto the tenets of **Fair Information Practices (FIPs)**, which include:

- **Notice/Awareness and Choice/Consent:** Users decide to provide information about their preferences and worldview in exchange for service.
- **Action/Participation:** Users can manage settings and download data.
- **Integrity/Security:** Users can turn on two-factor authentication.
- **Enforcement/Redress:** Companies may receive fines when issues arise.

### II. Limitations of the Current Paradigm

The standard FIPs approach, which emerged from the U.S. government in the late 20th century, has fundamental limitations:

1. **Burden on the User:** The "notice and consent" model puts the onus, or the work, of data protection on the user.
2. **Shaping Terms:** Users have little power to shape the terms, as the structure is designed to nudge them toward supplying data.
3. **Underlying Dynamics:** The paradigm is rooted in historical fears of government overreach (1960s–70s) and desires to cut back on regulatory power (1980s–90s).
4. **Difficulty of Reform:** Simply changing regulations is difficult because it leaves the underlying dynamics—the overemphasis on individual decisions—unchanged, and assumes that those who benefit from the current arrangement will willingly give up their power.

### III. Case Studies Demonstrating Failure of PII/Consent

The source uses three case studies to illustrate where the standard privacy approach (focusing on Personally Identifiable Information, PII, and individual consent) falls short:

|Case Study|Original Context|Misuse/Problem|Why Standard Approach Fails|Key Stake at Risk|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|**Havasupai Blood Samples**|Blood samples given to ASU researchers to study diabetes genetics.|Samples were used for other studies (mental illness, geographical origins) without specific consent.|It underlines the **collective dimension** to personal data; misuse affects people who share an identity.|Collective identity, sovereignty, and colonial relations.|
|**Crisis Text Line**|Users provide data during a crisis to connect with counselors for emotional help.|Data is repackaged and used by a for-profit spinoff to market customer service software.|Consent is given in a **moment of crisis** and there is a significant **shift of context** (personal trauma to consumer service).|Commercial use without compensating data originators.|
|**TSA Body Scanners**|Post-9/11 screening designed to produce full-body images; measures like blurring faces and disabling storage were implemented.|People whose bodies do not fit the norms (e.g., non-binary or trans people) are subject to additional scrutiny and exposure.|The concern is not PII, but the **body, dignity, values, and social norms**. The system reimposes norms around body features.|Power dynamics and social context.|

### IV. Contextual Integrity (CI) as an Alternative

The source introduces **Contextual Integrity (CI)**, proposed by Helen Nissenbaum (2004), as an alternative framework.

- CI defines privacy as being about **data flows**—specifically, appropriate flows.
- Appropriateness is judged by conformity with **expectations** between people in relationships within specific contexts.
- A context has "integrity" that needs to be respected for people to feel secure.

### V. Conclusion: Stakes in the Datafied World

The lecture concludes that FIPs and PII are merely a starting point, and that ToS provide very limited help in the datafied world. What matters more is the work done with data. The implications of data use become visible when expectations are violated. The true stakes go beyond privacy to include **power, vulnerability, dignity, and other collective concerns**. Finding alternatives requires moving beyond individual control and market exchange and paying attention to collective stakes like vulnerability and the "right to oblivion".
