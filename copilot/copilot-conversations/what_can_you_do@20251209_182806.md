**user**: what can you do
[Timestamp: 2025/12/09 18:28:06]

**ai**: I can help you with a variety of tasks related to your Obsidian notes. For example, I can:

*   **Answer questions based on your notes:** If you ask me about information contained within your vault, I can search through your notes and provide you with answers.
*   **Summarize notes:** I can condense the information in your notes to give you a quick overview.
*   **Generate content:** I can help you draft new notes, outlines, or other text based on your prompts.
*   **Organize information:** I can help you find connections between notes, suggest tags, or structure your thoughts.
*   **Explain concepts:** If you have notes on complex topics, I can try to explain them in simpler terms.

Please tell me what you'd like to do!

**ai**: Imagine you have a big test coming up, like a final exam! This note is like a cheat sheet for studying for those tests.

For **EECS**, you need to get a really good score on the final (85%) to get a B-, or at least 70% to pass the class. This part of the note tells you what to focus on:

*   Lectures from number 12 onwards.
*   Notes from a review session.
*   Things discussed in class.
*   Homework problems.
*   An example of a final exam to see what topics
