# My Obsidian Notes

This vault serves as my personal knowledge management system, a central hub for organizing and connecting information across various aspects of my life and studies.

## What You'll Find Here:

*   **Academic Notes:** Detailed notes from courses, including lectures, readings, and assignments. This section is particularly rich for subjects like EECS, IEOR, CS, and Data Science, with specific plans for exam preparation and topic breakdowns.
*   **Project Documentation:** Information related to personal and professional projects, including planning, progress tracking, and final outcomes.
*   **Research & Learning:** Notes on topics I'm exploring, articles I've read, and concepts I'm trying to understand.
*   **Personal Knowledge:** A space for general information, ideas, and anything else I want to remember or refer back to.

The goal is to create a interconnected web of knowledge, allowing for easy retrieval and synthesis of information. I aim to use Obsidian's linking capabilities to foster deeper understanding and discover new connections between different pieces of information.
