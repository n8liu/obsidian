**Thomas Kurn** → The "textbook tradition" refers to the standard, often misleading, way that science is represented, particularly in **persuasive and pedagogic science textbooks and classics** [i].

Key characteristics associated with this tradition include:

• **The Accumulation Model:** This tradition promotes the stereotype that scientific content is defined by the **observations, laws, and theories** contained within the books [i]. It portrays scientific development as a **piecemeal process of accumulation**, where scientists continuously contribute elements to an **ever-growing stockpile** of knowledge [i].

• **Historical View:** Historically, this perspective led historians to believe their primary task was to identify the origin point for every contemporary fact and describe the "error, myth and superstition" that slowed down this accumulation [i].

• **Suppression of Revolutions:** The focus on accumulation makes the underlying revolutionary structure of science difficult to see [i]. The essay specifically notes that it will analyze why **scientific revolutions have been so difficult to see** when viewed through the lens of the textbook tradition [i].
