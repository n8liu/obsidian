### The Denaturalization and Historicization of Decision-Making

The lecture aims to denaturalize and historicize decision-making, which has become a prominent way to frame agency. Prior to World War II, decision-making was not a culturally salient way to frame what it means for a person to act. Today, decisions and choices serve as templates through which we understand our agency—the ability to control our own lives—and our power to influence others’ decisions and choices. Agency is commonly understood as decision-making: the free choice of the “best” option among several alternatives at discrete moments in time.

The document offers a **co-productionist account** of decision-making. This account suggests that before machines could make decisions, people had to become the kinds of agents that make decisions; furthermore, before people could become decision-makers in the modern sense, they had to resemble machines. Co-production generally means that technology and society are mutually constituted. In this context, it specifically involves the interplay between technical models of rational decision-making (e.g., AI/Machine Learning, platform choice architecture) and societal conceptions (e.g., individualism, managerial social order, metaphors of human thinking).

### AI, History, and the Horizon of Expectations

The lecture views AI as a way for reading history (as suggested by Daniel Kelly). It touches upon the idea from German historian Reinhard Koselleck that massive, rapid technological change (progress) shears the horizon of expectations from the space of experience. AI is interpreted as a desperate, technical attempt to "suture" expectations and experience back together, effectively providing a technical fix for a problem caused by technology. However, this attempt risks bringing about the "end of history" by closing down possibilities.

### Pre-1945 Intellectual Traditions

Before 1945, two European intellectual traditions dealt with decisions and choices:

1. **Decisions (Legal/Political Contexts):** Decisions resulted from expert judgment, prudence, or experience. Alternatively, decisions were viewed either as the result of calculation and rule-following (e.g., the judge or bureaucrat as an automaton, reflecting liberal legal positivism) or, conversely, as irrational acts—what goes beyond the calculable, such as a “leap of faith” or spontaneous “free will”.
2. **Choices (Economic Contexts):** Choices were associated with the individual consumer who maximizes marginal utility when choosing between goods in a marketplace.

### The Formalization of Rational Decision-Making (Post-WWII)

The push to formalize and mathematize rational decision-making addressed several key problems:

- **Logistics and Optimization:** Solving issues related to World War II logistics, resource allocation, and optimization.
- **Bureaucratic Efficiency:** Making large and increasingly complex government bureaucracies more efficient.
- **Cold War and Existential Threat:** Fighting the Cold War and addressing the prospect of nuclear annihilation. This period fostered a distrust of human frailty and irrationality.
- **Neoliberalism:** The rise of anti-totalitarianism, market thinking, and an emphasis on the solitary, free-choosing individual.

### The Cyborg Sciences and Algorithmic Rationality

The concept of decision-making was formalized through the rise of **Cybernetics** and the **Cyborg Sciences** in the 1940s and 1950s. Cybernetics was an interdisciplinary project seeking a new universal science, defining reality as flows of information and blurring the boundaries between humans, animals, machines, and social systems.

Key components of the Cyborg Sciences include:

1. **Behaviorism:** Early 20th-century movements like B.F. Skinner’s “radical behaviorism” treated humans as mechanical systems responding to stimuli. **Operant conditioning** (stimulus-response, reward-punishment) aimed at behavior modification and predicting behaviors by creating them. _Walden Two_ (1948) provided a vision of a behaviorist utopia/dystopia where humans are rationally trained to follow only good behaviors.
2. **Game Theory and Rational Choice (Cold War):** John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern’s _Theory of Games and Economic Behavior_ (1944) modeled individual choices mathematically in “games”. Rational choice is framed as maximizing expected utility and is applied across microeconomics, political science, and military-strategic planning. The combination of calculation and rule-following produced **“algorithmic rationality,”** which is abstractable and mathematizable.
3. **Mind as Machine and Bureaucracy (Cognitive Science):** In the 1950s and 1960s, theories of Administrative Behavior and Cognitive Science emerged. Herbert Simon introduced **“bounded rationality,”** viewing minds and administrations as machines for information processing, decision-making, and problem-solving. This focus limited the forms of human thought and experience taken seriously to only those that could be captured by analogy to mechanical information processing.

### Behavioral Economics and Performative Decision-Making

Behavioral economics (1970s onward) challenged strict rationality. Researchers like Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky empirically studied how people _actually_ make decisions, identifying **heuristics and biases**—shortcuts and “fallacies” that represent a failure to behave “rationally”.

These findings led to theories of decision-making as **performative**, culminating in the development of **Choice Architecture** and **Nudges**.

- **Choice Architecture:** An environment structured specifically to present only structured choices.
- **Nudges:** Constrained choices that are pointed toward “preferred” outcomes.

Choice architecture is understood as a form of **“libertarian paternalism,”** a political theory where authorities subtly shape citizens’ actions but still allow them to make choices (soft social engineering). Power is expressed by deciding the scope for others’ decisions. This system manages people by subtly shaping their behavior and contrasts with the panopticon; it elicits preferred behaviors without necessarily relying on surveillance (“the view from above”).

Datafied infrastructures use choice architectures to channel perceptions, decisions, and behaviors, individually and at scale. **Hypernudges**, such as Google Maps (personalized and persistent), govern behaviors at the scale of a population, differentiating them from less personalized interventions like a speedbump.

### Decision-Making as an Artifact of Social Order

The concept of “decision-making” should be viewed as an artifact—it was made, not found—and it possesses an inherent politics that structures social order. By becoming invisible infrastructure, it shapes how we understand what it means to act, to be a human being, and how we imagine desirable futures, technologies, and forms of social order. This dominant framework risks displacing alternative ways to frame the human condition and ethics.

### Alternative Forms of Agency

The material emphasizes the limitations of framing human agency solely as decision-making. Alternative forms of agency include:

- Instinct and intuition, feeling our way into an action over time.
- Imagining what else is possible.
- The capacity and resources needed to realize one’s goals.
- Deliberating and discovering together with others what matters and who we are.
- Living and acting together with others.
