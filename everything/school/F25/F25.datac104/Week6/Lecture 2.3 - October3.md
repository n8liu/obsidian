### I. The Politics of Artifacts: Winner’s Challenge

The lecture introduces the question of whether a technological artifact, such as a gun, is merely a neutral instrument used to carry out pre-existing goals, or whether it possesses a kind of agency or bears some responsibility for outcomes. This inquiry, popularized by Langdon Winner, centers on the political nature of technology.

Winner’s central concern is that society often submits to "practical necessity" regarding technology adoption instead of engaging in democratic discussion about its inherent politics. He suggests that if some technologies are inherently political, perhaps they should not be built. Winner outlines two primary ways technology possesses politics:

1. **Settling Issues:** This occurs when the design or arrangement of a specific technical device serves to resolve an issue within a community.
2. **Inherently Political Technologies:** These are "man-made systems that appear to require, or to be strongly compatible with, particular kinds of political relationships". Choosing such a technology necessitates choosing a specific form of political life. This link is based on "intractable properties" of certain technologies being strongly or unavoidably linked to specific institutionalized patterns of power and authority (e.g., the atom bomb or nuclear power).

However, Winner complicates his own argument by noting that the claim that some technologies are inherently political might be interpreted as saying that accepted reasons of "practical necessity"—especially the need to maintain crucial technological systems—tend to eclipse other forms of moral and political reasoning. This internal complication risks suggesting that the politics lie in the discourse and justification surrounding the technology, leading back toward a social determination of technology. The lecture notes that the concepts of technological determinism and technological neutrality are ultimately two sides of the same coin.

### II. Historical and Philosophical Context of Technology

To understand technology's political nature, the lecture provides a historical survey of philosophical treatments:

- **Techne (Ancient Greece):** Defined as craft, activity, or a form of knowledge or reason, but held a lower moral status than other activities.
- **Marx and Machine:** Marx occasionally echoed technological determinism (e.g., "The hand-mill gives you society with the feudal lord; the steam-mill society with the industrial capitalist"), but also argued that machines materialize the prior social organization of labor and are instruments for shaping social order.
- **Heidegger (Gestell):** Technology is not merely an instrument or tool, but a form of truth or a way of revealing the world. Modern technology reveals the world as a **resource**—a stockpile, on call, and orderable (e.g., a river revealed as an energy source through a dam, or the earth revealed as a coal mine).
- **Critical Theory (Frankfurt School):** Thinkers like Adorno and Horkheimer saw "Enlightenment" (rationality) as turning into a domination of nature that ultimately turns on human beings. Marcuse viewed technology as a form of social control, arguing that it functions ideologically by becoming a type of rationality that legitimates modern social order. Habermas recognized instrumental/practical reason as essential, but noted its virulent expansion, corrupting moral and communicative capacities.

This history establishes technology as both a material artifact and a kind of social process or logic.

### III. Actor-Network Theory (ANT) and the Resolution of Ambiguity

Bruno Latour's Actor-Network Theory (ANT) is presented as a framework to resolve the ambiguities found in Winner's work—specifically the difficulty in separating the technical from the social.

Latour proposes suspending assumptions about what is "social" or "technical" and instead examining how human and non-human objects interact to form collectives. In this view, there is no society without technical objects, and no technical objects that aren't composed of social relations.

Key concepts in ANT include:

- **Delegation and Translation:** ANT analyzes the **delegation of agency** to non-human objects (e.g., seatbelts, door closers, speed bumps). Every delegation is a **translation** that changes what the actors (human and non-human) "are," modifying the goals or action programs inscribed into each one. This allows for "action at a distance," making absent actions present.
- **Black Boxes:** Technical objects act as "black-boxes," meaning they contain a whole history of prior design decisions, negotiations, and social inputs that are hidden from the user, allowing for streamlined interaction without requiring users to think about the underlying complexity.

Latour's approach is highly empirical, urging analysis of the particular collective and its specific history and shape, rather than assuming politics from the start. He suggests that artifacts change the meaning of politics by introducing new kinds of "detours" to manage human actions.
