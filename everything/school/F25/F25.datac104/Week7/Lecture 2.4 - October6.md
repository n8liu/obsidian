### I. Definition and Role of Surveillance

Surveillance is defined as seeing, knowing, power, and systems. It involves watching people to anticipate their actions. Surveillance is fundamental to how social order is constituted. It makes social order by observing deviations and making them actionable, allowing for punishment or preemption. This process is carried out through sociotechnical systems that become routinely embedded and invisibly fade into the landscape.

### II. Narrative Templates for Understanding Surveillance

The way we understand surveillance is shaped by three key narrative templates:

1. **1984 (Orwell):** Characterized by an Orwellian “surveillance state” where an all-powerful state actor (“Big Brother”) controls the population through inescapable, total domination.
2. **Panopticon (Bentham):** Focuses on discipline and behavior modification, where individuals are continuously exposed to observation but cannot see the watcher. This leads to internalized, normalized self-judgment.
3. **Global Analytics:** Focused on security, global oversight, and pinpoint accuracy. The goal is to discriminate signal from noise to identify, target, and preempt "bad actors". The narrative suggests that only bad actors have cause for concern.

### III. Historical Context and Modern Crystallization

In the 20th-century U.S., civil liberties faced infringement during wartime targeting of “internal enemies” through spying, such as mail surveillance and wiretapping, exemplified by the FBI COINTELPRO (1956-1971).

The modern data analytic surveillance was crystallized by 9/11 and the "War on Terror". Key elements included:

- **Legislation and Programs:** The PATRIOT Act (2001) enabled the bulk collection of phone metadata. The "Terrorist Surveillance Program" involved NSA warrantless surveillance (2001-2007).
- **Snowden Revelations (2013):** Leaked documents exposed massive foreign and domestic surveillance by national security agencies. This included PRISM, which collected internet communications from platforms and ISPs, and gathered phone call metadata and email traffic.
- **State-Corporate Partnerships:** This modern surveillance relies on close cooperation between big tech firms and the U.S. security apparatus, driven by the government’s desire for total visibility.

### IV. Characteristics and Stakes of Contemporary Surveillance

Modern surveillance is ubiquitous (everywhere) and global. It is characterized as embedded, inconspicuous, suspicionless, automatic, bulk, cheap, granular, and continuous.

**Differential Exposure** While pervasive, surveillance has a broad but non-uniform impact; there is "differential exposure". Infringement on American Civil Liberty post-9/11 is differentially distributed. Surveillance technologies are repurposed for new “others” and construct the difference between the "homogenous nation" and "outsiders," such as Muslims, non-citizens, migrants, refugees, and terrorists.

**The Military-Industrial-Surveillance Complex** Surveillance technology is driven by porous boundaries between corporations and the state (defense, policing, carceral institutions). This "military-industrial-surveillance complex" is a networked set of companies building dual-use technologies that serve both military-defense purposes and are sold into civilian markets (e.g., Palantir, Amazon).

**Alternatives and Resistance** The source notes that the current culture of surveillance is contingent, leaving room for agency to resist and make changes. Alternatives include data minimization (like GDPR in Europe), building alternative technologies (like the Signal app), and building alternative social order.
