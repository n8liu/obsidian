# Data Futures
## What work do narratives do for us?
- Narratives are at work everywhere -- including technologies
- “The sewing machine will, after some time, effectively banish ragged and unclad humanity from every class. ... [These machines] may do 100 times more towards clothing all the indigent and feeble than the united fingers of all the charitable and willing ladies collected through the civilized world.”  (1860)
	- basically said since made everyone in the world should have clothes, but realistically makes no sense
## Digging into narratives
- Stories in time that express and explain things that matter to people
Descriptive, Selective, Meaningful, Directive
- Who are we?
- What is the world like?
- How do things work?
- What needs to be done?
- What future is possible, desirable, and envitable?

## What work do narratives do for us?
- Time is a fundamental structure of human life experience (duration, present)
- Narratives give coherence to lives 
- Narratives are always at work in the world (“Change the narrative”)  
- Narratives are a sophisticated way of  
	- Working with time  
	- Dealing with empirical reality 
- (meaning: data doesn’t do everything)

## Technology shapes a society’s narratives --  and is shaped by that society’s narratives
- narratives are important

## Why and how do we “future”? Beyond prediction
lens → gathering, mirroring, and distorting → horizon

## Data technologies work with the future - in ways that go well beyond prediction
- Shape and guide actions and outcomes (Songdo, use case exercises)  
- Prevent particular futures (Hildebrandt, Minority Report)  
- Recycle or remix the past, including the society that made it (algorithmic decision systems, scoring systems)
## Narrative templates  
Standard narrative patterns  
Available for reuse  
“Everyone” knows them  
Like cookie cutters pressed onto reality  
Then decorate them individually

## What are other ways that we future? Beyond narrative fiction
Projecting, planning, predicting  
- Forecasting, scenario planning  
- Risk assessment, predictive analytics  
- Investing, venture capital, futures markets  
Making, building, doing  
- Making companies  
- Engineering (and some science)  
- Social action  
- Art

### The Role and Function of Narratives

The lecture begins by establishing the importance of narratives, which are stories in time that express and explain things that matter to people. Narratives are not just passive stories; they are actively at work everywhere, including in the development and perception of technology. They serve several key functions:

- **Providing Coherence:** Narratives give structure and meaning to human life and experiences.
- **Answering Fundamental Questions:** They help us understand who we are, what the world is like, how things work, and what futures are possible, desirable, or inevitable.
- **Working with Time and Reality:** Narratives are a sophisticated method for working with time and dealing with empirical reality, suggesting that data alone is insufficient to capture meaning.
- **Shaping and Being Shaped by Technology:** There is a reciprocal relationship where technology shapes a society's narratives, and those narratives, in turn, shape the technology. An example is the 1860 quote about the sewing machine, which tells a story about technology banishing poverty.

### Understanding "Futuring"

"Futuring" is presented as a concept that goes beyond simple prediction. It involves a wide range of practices and ways of thinking about the future, often with the goal of influencing the present. Futuring can be positive, negative, or presented as neutral.

There are two primary motivations for engaging in futuring:

1. **To Impose Order and Control:** This includes activities like predicting, steering, managing uncertainty, defining options, and shaping beliefs. Examples are forecasting, risk assessment, predictive analytics, investing, and venture capital.
2. **To Open Up Imagination:** This involves using the future to create tools for thought and feeling, envisioning possibilities, and making potential futures "real enough" to be taken seriously before they happen. This can be seen in art, social action, and engineering.

All forms of futuring are described as a type of fiction, presented in different modes and voices, and their outcomes are always contested.

### Sociotechnical Narratives and Futuring in the Datafied World

The lecture emphasizes "sociotechnical narratives," which are stories that project, imagine, anticipate, and shape our understanding and development of technology. These narratives act as lenses that can gather, mirror, or distort our view of the future.

Examples of routine futuring in our data-driven world include:

- **"Use Case" Brainstorming:** This common business practice is a form of speculative futuring.
- **Smart Cities:** The concept of smart cities is a form of everyday utopian futuring.
- **Speculative and Dystopian Fiction:** These genres, whether explicitly labeled as fiction or not, are designed to sensitize us to potential futures and provoke action. Examples include _The Matrix_ and the "Diana's onlife world" scenario, which imagines a life saturated with pre-emptive technologies. The goal of such futuring can be to _prevent_ certain outcomes, as seen in stories like _Minority Report_.

### Narrative Templates

A key concept is the "narrative template," which is a standard, reusable narrative pattern that is widely understood within a culture. These templates are like "cookie cutters" pressed onto reality, providing a familiar structure that can then be customized.

- **The _1984_ Template:** George Orwell's novel _1984_ serves as a powerful dystopian template. Terms like "Orwellian," "Big Brother," and the phrase "2+2=5" have become cultural shorthand for a specific type of oppressive, surveillance-based future, and this template is often replayed or remixed in discussions about data and AI.

### Key Takeaways and Critical Analysis

The lecture concludes with several key takeaways for analysis:

- **Examine How Futuring Works:** It is crucial to think about why we "future" and the various methods we use to do so.
- **Recognize and Analyze Narratives:** Be aware that narratives are everywhere. One should ask where they originate and what work they are intended to do.
- **Denaturalize Narratives:** We should not accept the narratives we are given at face value. A critical approach involves looking for whose narratives are being presented and, just as importantly, whose are being excluded or ignored. This is a constant point of contestation.
### The Power and Function of Narratives

A narrative is defined as a story told over time that gives meaning and explanation to people in the present. Narratives are fundamental to human life and perform several critical functions. They are:

- **Descriptive and Directive**: Narratives can be descriptive, explaining "Who are we?" and "What is the world like?". They can also be directive, suggesting "What needs to be done".
- **Selective and Meaningful**: They are not arbitrary sequences of events but are constructed by selecting specific events from the flow of experience to create meaning.
- **Performative**: Narratives about technology often shape public perception and point toward outcomes that their creators find desirable. By suggesting where things are going, they encourage people to act in ways that bring that future into being.
- **Time-Oriented**: Narratives are a primary way humans work with time, which is a fundamental structure of our experience. They help us deal with the continuity of self over time (duration) and give meaning to the present moment.
- **Meaning and Causation**: They help us determine what is significant and provide explanations for why things happened.
- **Identity-Forming**: Personal identity is deeply tied to the continuity of our personal narratives over time.

A common pattern with narratives about new technology is an overemphasis on its liberating power to encourage public buy-in, while often overlooking the surrounding social contexts. The sewing machine, for instance, was framed with narratives about freeing women from manual labor and providing clothes for everyone. These narratives are frequently "naturalized," meaning they are presented as natural and inevitable, even though they are constructed and can be remade.

### Understanding "Futuring"

Futuring is the process of giving the future meaning, rather than just trying to predict it. The future is inherently indeterminate and not yet real, which causes both wonder and dread in us as mortal beings. We attempt to manage this uncertainty by "futuring," or projecting ourselves forward over the horizon. A metaphor for this process is looking toward the horizon (the future) through a lens (our present view) that simultaneously distorts, mirrors, and gathers information.

Futuring takes many forms, from the mundane to the complex:

- **Everyday Fictions**: Company brainstorming exercises can be seen as a form of speculative fiction. Similarly, utopian narratives like "smart cities" or dystopian ones like social credit scoring systems are crafted to seem imaginable and everyday.
- **Analytic Work**: Futuring can also be an analytical tool. For example, a narrative about a datafied world can sensitize and alert us to its features and consequences, prompting us to think critically about its impact on our legal systems.
- **Artistic Engagement**: Dystopian fictions like "The Matrix" are not just entertainment; they are artworks that absorb us and engage us in feeling and thinking about a future that is not yet real.

### Data Technologies and Their Role in Futuring

Data technologies are deeply involved in the work of futuring, going beyond simple prediction by actively shaping the future. They turn data from the past into inputs for the future. The lecture identifies three types of technologies that do this:

1. **Shaping and Guiding Technologies**: These systems shape and guide actions and outcomes according to specific design choices, such as in the planned city of Songdo.
2. **Preemptive Technologies**: These technologies aim to prevent certain futures from happening, thereby cutting back human agency.
3. **Predictive Technologies**: These recycle and remix the past to make predictions, a theme often explored in media like _Black Mirror_.

### Narrative Templates and Their Limitations

Narrative templates are standard, reusable patterns or "cookie cutters" that are widely understood. Two prominent examples are:

- **1984 / "Big Brother"**: Crafted by George Orwell with Nazi Germany in mind, this has become a powerful template for understanding totalitarianism and surveillance.
- **AI Creation**: This template suggests a godlike role for humans, creating artificial intelligence in our own image.

A critical issue with these templates is that they originate from specific individuals or groups and do not represent the full spectrum of human experience. The AI narrative, for example, is often presented as universal but tends to depict intelligent machines as white, reflecting underlying assumptions of its creators. This highlights the need to "denaturalize" narratives we are handed and examine the assumptions baked into them.

### Afrofuturism: An Alternative Approach to Futuring

Afrofuturism offers a powerful alternative to dominant narrative templates. It is a genre of fantasy and speculative fiction that centers on Black culture and the experience of the African diaspora. Rather than a future of erasure, Afrofuturism narrates a future of Black technological thriving. This approach demonstrates how a narrator's unique positionality shapes their futuring. It leads to different desires, different conceptions of what it means to be human, and a conscious effort to situate one's own perspective rather than universalizing it.

### Broadening the Scope of Futuring

Futuring extends beyond fictional narratives and art. It encompasses a wide range of activities focused on creating the future, including:

- **Analysis and Prediction**: Forecasting, scenario planning, risk assessment, and predictive analytics.
- **Investment**: Venture capital and futures markets, which are fundamentally bets on the future.
- **Creation**: The act of making and building, whether through starting companies, engineering, social action, or art.
