Based on the sources provided, data is not a raw, natural material that is simply found; it is actively **made** by people, for specific purposes, and within contexts that shape its final form. Understanding _how_ data is made is crucial because this process embeds choices, assumptions, and power dynamics into the data itself.

### Case Study: Air Quality Index (AQI)

The Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) provides a clear example of data making.

- **The Phenomenon vs. The Data:** The raw **phenomenon** is air pollution and people's direct, personal experiences with it—what can be called the **"view from below"**. This is contrasted with the **"view from above,"** which is the data created to represent that phenomenon.
- **Abstraction and Usefulness:** The BAAQMD measures various pollutants and transforms them into a single, simplified Air Quality Index (AQI). This is an act of **abstraction**, which simplifies complex reality to make it useful. The color-coded AQI scale is intuitive and allows institutions like school districts to make swift, concrete decisions, such as closing schools during wildfires.
- **Data is Political:** Because the AQI is depended upon and integrated into everyday life to ground decisions, it is inherently **political**. The purposes of the BAAQMD shape the data it creates, and local community needs, such as concerns about refinery flares, also influence what data gets made.

### Core Concepts in Data Making

Several key processes and concepts are central to the making of data:

- **Representation:** Data works by having one thing **stand in for another**; data represents a phenomenon. This act is always **selective**—it highlights certain aspects of reality while ignoring others. This selection is not necessarily a bias to be eliminated but a **perspective** that is essential for utility. For example, a MUNI map would be useless if it were a perfect replica of the world; its usefulness comes from its selective representation. Representation is a two-sided coin: it creates **knowledge** about the world but is also an exercise of **power**, allowing data to speak for the world and legitimize political decisions.
    
- **Classification:** This is the "spatial-temporal segmentation of the world" into categories. All classification systems embed choices and human judgments, which **valorize some points of view and silence others**. These human-made categories, like those for race or gender, change over time but can become **"naturalized,"** meaning they are taken for granted as if they were part of the natural world. A critical approach to data involves "denaturalizing" these built-in assumptions.
    
- **Power:** Power is the "asymmetric capacity... to organize others’ behavior". In data making, power determines whose goals are served, who gets to participate in the process, and which phenomena are measured. Examining power helps identify and give voice to those who are not represented in the data.
    

### The Consequences of Data Making

- **Data Travels:** Data moves beyond its original context, but it carries its built-in choices and world-making effects with it.
- **Data in AI and Machine Learning:** When this data is fed into ML and AI systems, it is often treated as objective **"ground truth"**. The systems then reproduce the social order and assumptions embedded in the data when they were originally made.

The main takeaway is the need to develop a habit of critically asking how data was made: Who made it? How? Why? and in what context?. This allows us to see the choices embedded in representations and classifications and to understand the relationship between what is counted and what ultimately "counts" in society.
