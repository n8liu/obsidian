Personal data is defined not only legally, as "any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person" under GDPR, but also more broadly as **information originating from individuals’ bodies and behaviors**. The creation and use of this data have significant stakes, which can be understood through a case study of Los Angeles's Coordinated Entry System (CES) for the unhoused. This system uses a survey and algorithm to represent and rank individuals by a "vulnerability" score (VI-SPDAT) to match them with housing resources.

The stakes of personal data are revealed through several key properties:

- **Representation:** Data systems _represent_ people and phenomena, which reshapes identities and determines "who counts". In the CES, the VI-SPDAT score becomes a necessary representation for an unhoused person to be heard and access resources. However, this can lead to **"representational harm"**—harm that comes simply from being represented in data, such as misrepresentation. People may feel pressured to provide intimate information, only for that data to take on a life of its own, speaking for them beyond their control.
    
- **Classification:** Data systems classify by organizing people and knowledge into categories, essentially "sorting" them into boxes. This process embeds social judgments into technical systems that can reshape the social order. The VI-SPDAT score, for example, classifies people by turning them into vulnerability scores, deciding what parts of their life matter to the system and conveying their level of "risk" to authorities.
    
- **Abstraction:** Abstraction is the process of turning people into fungible units by looking aside from their personal stories and suffering. This can be dehumanizing, as illustrated by the 1960s protest slogan at Berkeley, "I am a UC student: do not fold, spindle, or mutilate me,” which was a cry against the bureaucracy represented by punch cards. In the CES, the vulnerability score **abstracts away from a person's life story**, leading many to feel they are being treated as a datapoint rather than a person in need of housing.
    
- **Circulation:** Data is often decontextualized as it travels and is re-settled in new contexts. A VI-SPDAT score can circulate across different agencies, potentially including the police, where it can be reinterpreted and take on new meanings and consequences.
    
- **Relationality:** Personal data is never just about one individual; it is relational and collective. Data about one person can implicate others, such as how genetic data from one person reveals information about their relatives. It also creates new relationships by grouping people who are classified similarly into the same "bucket".
    

### Harms and Vulnerability

These properties of data can lead to two types of harm:

1. **Allocative Harm:** When a data system negatively impacts the distribution of resources to a person or group.
2. **Representational Harm:** Harm from being misrepresented or having one's personhood modified by the representation itself.

Ultimately, personal data is deeply entangled with **human vulnerability**—the condition of being exposed to the risk of injury. This condition is central to being human but is distributed unequally, and technology plays a role in shaping who becomes vulnerable and how.
