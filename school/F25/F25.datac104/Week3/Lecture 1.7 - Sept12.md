This lecture provides a historical and sociotechnical critique of the "global view" of data. It traces the origins of this perspective and examines the institutions and narratives that construct it, using global population statistics as a key case study.

### The Origins of the "Global View"

The concept of a "global view" began with the state's need to survey its territory and population to manage resources, collect taxes, and build an army. This practice is a form of **biopower**, where the state derives power from managing the conditions of its population's life.

In the 20th century, the **administrative state** institutionalized the collection of population statistics through agencies like the Census Bureau, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the Centers for Disease Control. This process creates abstractions, such as "the economy," that stand above individual experiences. This view is not limited to the state; non-state actors like insurance companies, pollsters, and marketers also contribute to creating it through practices like sampling, surveying, and creating standardized categories.

### The "Global" Context and Institutions

The modern concept of "the global" was shaped by several post-World War II developments:

- **The Cold War**, which divided the world into three political blocs.
- **Decolonization** and the emergence of the "Global South".
- **Economic globalization**, which expanded Western multinational corporations and economic models.
- The creation of **international institutions** like the United Nations (UN), World Bank, and International Monetary Fund (IMF).

These institutions, particularly the **UN Statistical Division** and the **IMF**, set the international standards for collecting and monitoring data, such as national GDPs. This process embeds certain narratives into the data itself. The overarching narrative is one of a **linear flow from better data to better governance and, ultimately, to better lives**, though the lecture questions for whom this improvement is intended. These data institutions are **performative**, meaning they help create the realities they claim to merely describe, such as by operationalizing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into numerical indicators that track progress.

### Case Study: Gapminder.org and Population Statistics

The lecture uses **Gapminder.org**, an organization that visualizes global population data, as a primary case study.

- Gapminder promotes a narrative of global improvement, with visualizations suggesting that countries are progressing toward the health and economic levels of Europe and America.
- This narrative is tied to ideas about economic development that involve regulating fertility through **demography** and **"family planning"**, disciplines that have historical links to eugenics.
- This approach represents a **"god's eye view"** or a **"view from above"** that exercises biopower over the global population on behalf of international organizations.

### Alternative Narratives and Critiques

The lecture contrasts Gapminder's narrative with critical historical accounts that uncover a less innocent story:

- Historian Emily Klancher Merchant points to the mid-20th-century fear of a "population bomb," a eugenics-inflected narrative that non-white populations in the Global South were reproducing at a dangerous rate.
- Michelle Murphy's work shows how Bangladesh was turned into a **"living laboratory"** for the Global North to experiment with birth control on girls and women, continuing a longer history of imperial subjection.
- Asoka Bandarage critiques the underlying assumption that the primary global crisis is population growth caused by women of color in poor countries.
- Vincanne Adams questions what sovereignty means when the health of populations is controlled by donor countries, philanthropists, and corporate actors who set the metrics that allocate resources.

These critiques reveal an implicit narrative that **problematizes the fertility of women in the Global South**, framing it as something to be managed by experts and statisticians from the Global North.

### Key Takeaways

The lecture concludes that data is not neutral. The creation of global data can lead to **representational harm**, where people are represented in ways that are instrumentalizing, unfair, limiting, or out of their control. The key takeaways are to:

- Recognize that global datasets come with a **"view from above"**.
- Understand the roles of the administrative state and international institutions in building this view.
- Critically ask **who creates global data, how they make it, why, and what it leaves out**.
