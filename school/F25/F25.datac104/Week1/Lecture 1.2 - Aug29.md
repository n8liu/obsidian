Based on the sources provided, this lecture introduces the concept of the **"datafied world,"** a world profoundly shaped by data-driven technologies like AI and machine learning. The course aims to "denaturalize" this world, showing that its current state was not inevitable but rather the result of specific historical developments.

To structure this concept, the lecture presents the datafied world as being composed of four distinct layers that have accumulated over time:

1. **Data Layer**: The foundational layer where instruments produce signals that are then translated into data.
2. **Analytics Layer**: Where the raw data is worked on and processed using rigorous techniques to make it useful.
3. **Algorithms Layer**: Consists of automated, rule-based processes that can act independently, driven by a culture aiming to advance specific goals.
4. **Autonomous Agents Layer**: The final layer, built upon the others, where systems can "learn" and adapt through feedback loops.

The lecture uses the real-world case of rental pricing algorithms, like RealPage's YieldStar software, to illustrate that the concerns around these technologies are not just technical but also political and ethical. This example highlights that algorithms must be more than just accurate; they must also be **fair**. The lecture suggests using "HCE tools" to analyze these systems, asking critical questions about power and who gets to make key decisions.

Finally, the lecture discusses different narratives for understanding the relationship between technology and society:

- **Technological Determinism**: A common story where technology is the main driver of history, and society simply has to adapt to its changes.
- **Sociotechnical Narratives**: The approach favored by the course, which sees technology and society in a **reciprocal relationship**, where each shapes the other. Understanding this mutual influence is presented as essential for acting ethically in the datafied world.

The main takeaways are to be able to describe the layers of the datafied world and to be familiar with key concepts like technological determinism and the application of HCE tools.
